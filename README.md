# SoftDef Frontend Intern Test

> **Note**: I tried to replicate the actual Figma UI as closely as possible but also added a few extra tweaks to ensure full functionality. All features are implemented while keeping the design pixel-perfect and responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile. 

This is a simple **Next.js** web application built as part of an assignment. It replicates the product listing screen from Figma with **clean, reusable components**, **pixel-accurate UI**, and **fully working features** like **filters, sorting, and pagination**.
